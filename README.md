ðŸ’¼ **Current Project: Connecting Gatsby & Drupal**  
I'm building a dynamic **Recipe and Article Site** that connects to a Drupal backend using **GraphQL** and **Gatsby**. This web app fetches and displays content-rich recipes and engaging articles all about food and cooking, delivered with smooth interactivity. Planned upgrades? A **user login** for saving your favorite recipes and articles!
